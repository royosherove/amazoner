Amazoner by Roy Osherove
------------------------------
About Amazoner:
Amazoner was designed to make one thing very easy if you're a blog writer who's also an Amazone Associate:
The abilty to recommend books that you like using your associate ID so that you'll get a pittance whenever someone actually buys them.
The main form allows you to enter a search query for a book's title (or part of it).
You'll then get a list of the first 10 books that match that title along with their authors and a small screenshot of the book cover.
That should be enough information for you to select the book you wanted to recommend.
The next step is to create an associate link from the book you chose. That's very easy.
Simply right click on the row of the book you want and select one of three choices.
1. Copy title as link: Copies to the clipboard an html link with the title as text and the link reffering to the book's homepage along with your associate ID
2. Copy image as link: the same as the first only instead of the title text, you get the small cover image as a link with your associate ID
3. Comy both as link: Creates a center-aligned HTML with the book image and title below it as a link with your associate ID.

Now simply go to your favorite HTML editor (Can be a WYSIWYG editor as well) and simply PASTE (CTRL-V) into the place you want. 

Important notes:
----------------
1. This application uses the Amazon Web Services account for me: Roy Osherove. 
I encourage you to create your own amazon web services account at amazon 
and changing the Web Service account ID for this applciation to your own.
You can do this by going to Options->Change Web Service Credentials.
If you're going to use my account -please be respectful and don't 
hammer any servers with it, or I'll be the one screwed over by your actions!

2. You can only search books, and only by title. 
That's all I needed so that all I created.

3. Change the associate ID to your ID in the main dialog, or I'll get all the credit for someone purchasing your books.
The setting should be saved automatically when the application closes (unless it crashes...)
